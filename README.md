# Bible-Quizzer
This is an ongoing project to try and familiarize myself more with the Java language.
Currently this program will fetch a random Old Testament book of the Bible with a random verse,
and it is up to the user to choose which of 4 random books the verse belongs in.

I plan to implement a better third party parser (probably jsoup) because my handcrafted version is
buggy in some instances.
